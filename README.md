# ColorTypes

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SimonDanisch/ColorTypes.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SimonDanisch/ColorTypes.jl)

Color types for Julia, building uppon FixedSizeArrays.
This way, they offer rich functionality without a lot of code.
Color specific functionality was not added yet, as this should happen by integrating ColorTypes into Color.jl.
